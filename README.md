## Media Library

### General information:
In this project I created a parent class named Media with three subclasses: Book, Movie, and CD. Each subclass features properties, getters and methods. The subclasses also inherited the following properties from the parent class: title (string), isCheckedOut (boolean, initially false), and ratings (array, initially empty); and methods:getAverageRating(), .toggleCheckOutStatus(), and .addRating().
